# Pyxz

After cloning:

- pipenv install django
- pip install django-taggit
- python -m pip install Pillow


** So currently the home page has the modal semi set up, i have it so if you want to exit the modal you must click on the photo

**notice that the home screen has diffrent styling when compared to the other screens... that is because i am useing w3 css framework into the project! (dont worry everything is coded in so no new dependencies!) Now that I implymented that i might be able to use a more advanced framework that looks better... here are the docs for the one i used. -> https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp 

next should be:
1. adding a form to the modal to add new comments
2. looping and displaying all comments in each photo

I'm confident you will me able to navigate through the rest because its stuff you all know :)

we def need to start working on the forms so a user can add new photos/comments/like?/etc!

have fun guys!!

slack me with what you think so far i might be able to catch a meeting before 9am...MAYBE

PS. if you could replicate what i did in the homepage everywhere pictures show up that would be cool... i can also do it later on.
